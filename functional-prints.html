<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
I believe in the potential of 3D printers. They have the ability to create on demand solutions that no company would
feel they have enough profit motive to create for you. They allow everyone to make decisions as to what they want their
surroundings to be built like. Everyone has access to create and build now, instead of this ability being locked in to a
select few. 
</p>

<p>
3D printers may never fully live up to their hype. I want to explore here the idea of functional 3D prints. Further
exploration will be around making parametric designs that allow others to customize the design without being a designer
themselves. Intelligent decisions can be made by the original designer to allow others the ability to make the final few
customizations needed to truly adapt the product to their needs.
