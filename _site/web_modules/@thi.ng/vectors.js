/**
 * Vec2/3/4 view based buffer transformation for {@link VecOpVV} type
 * ops and supporting arbitrary component and element layouts of all
 * input and output buffers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The given pre-initialized vectors MUST be separate instances, are
 * used as sliding cursors / views of their respective backing buffers
 * and will be modified as part of the transformation process (though
 * the input buffers themselves are treated as immutable, unless `out`
 * is configured to use one of the input buffers).
 *
 * In each iteration `op` is called via `op(out, a, b)`, followed by
 * cursor updates to process the next vector view. No bounds checking is
 * performed.
 *
 * This function returns `out`'s backing buffer.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // each input buffer contains 2 2D vectors, but using
 * // different strided data layouts
 * mapVV(
 *   // transformation function
 *   add,
 *   // init output buffer view
 *   new Vec2(),
 *   // wrap 1st input buffer & configure offset & component stride
 *   new Vec2([1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0], 0, 2),
 *   // wrap 2nd input buffer
 *   new Vec2([0,10,0,0,20,0,0,30,0,0,40], 1, 3),
 *   2, // num vectors
 *   2, // output element stride
 *   8, // input #1 element stride
 *   6  // input #2 element stride
 * );
 * // [ 11, 22, 33, 44 ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, `Vec2/3/4.iterator()` combined with transducers can be
 * used to achieve the same (and more flexible) transformations, but
 * will incur more intermediate object allocations. `mapV*()` functions
 * only use (and mutate) the provided vector instances and do not
 * allocate any further objects.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // output buffer
 * const out = new Array(4);
 *
 * tx.run(
 *   tx.map(([o, a, b]) => add(o, a, b)),
 *   tx.zip(
 *      Vec2.iterator(out, 2),
 *      Vec2.iterator([1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0], 2, 0, 2, 8),
 *      Vec2.iterator([0,10,0,0,20,0,0,30,0,0,40], 2, 1, 3, 6),
