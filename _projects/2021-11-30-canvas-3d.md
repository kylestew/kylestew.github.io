<canvas id="canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 46vw;"></canvas>

<script type="module" src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/scripts/canvas-3d/main.js"></script>

_tap `r` to randomize, `s` to save a frame_

Original idea by [Matt Deslauriers](https://www.mattdesl.com/) in his [Canvas Sketch Examples](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/master/examples/canvas-geometric-3d.js)

## What's Going On Here?

I would usually use WebGL to make something like this. The Canvas API with its 2D drawing functions was used instead to rasterize a generative 3D object. This exercise was a chance to better understand cameras, depth, and transforms. See if you can spot the rendering issue (hint: think "deeply").
